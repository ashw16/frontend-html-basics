    <h1>Atmosphere</h1>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth">atmosphere of Earth</a> is composed of nitrogen (78 %), oxygen (21 %), argon (0.9 %), carbon dioxide (0.04 %) and trace gases. Most organisms use oxygen for respiration; lightning and bacteria perform nitrogen fixation which produces ammonia that is used to make nucleotides and amino acids; plants, algae, and cyanobacteria use carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. The layered composition of the atmosphere minimises the harmful effects of sunlight, ultraviolet radiation, solar wind, and cosmic rays and thus protects the organisms from genetic damage. The current composition of the atmosphere of the Earth is the product of billions of years of biochemical modification of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoatmosphere">paleoatmosphere</a> by living organisms</p>
