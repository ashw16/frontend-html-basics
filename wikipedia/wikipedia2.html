    <h1>Aerospace engineering</h1>
    <p><b>Aerospace engineering</b> is the primary field of <a href="engineering">engineering</a> concerned with the development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft">aircraft</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft">spacecraft</a><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineering#cite_note-3">[3]</sup></a>. It has two major and overlapping branches: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronautics">aeronautical</a> engineering and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronautics">astronautical</a> engineering. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avionics">Avionics</a> engineering is similar, but deals with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_engineering">electronics</a> side of aerospace engineering.
    "Aeronautical engineering" was the original term for the field. As flight technology advanced to include vehicles operating in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space">outer space</a>, the broader term "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace">aerospace</a> engineering" has come into use. Aerospace engineering, particularly the astronautics branch, is often colloquially referred to as "rocket science"</p>
