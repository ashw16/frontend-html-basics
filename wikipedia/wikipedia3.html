    <h1>Aircraft</h1>
    <p>An <b>aircraft</b> (pl.: aircraft) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle">vehicle</a> that is able to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight">fly</a> by gaining support from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth">air</a>. It counters the force of gravity by using either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoyancy">static lift</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_(force)">dynamic lift</a> of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airfoil">airfoil</a> or, in a few cases, direct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_lift">downward thrust</a> from its engines. Common examples of aircraft include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane">airplanes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter">helicopters</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airship">airships</a> (including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blimp">blimps</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_(aircraft)">gliders</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_paragliding">paramotors</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_air_balloon">hot air balloons</a>.
    The human activity that surrounds aircraft is called aviation. The science of aviation, including designing and building aircraft, is called aeronautics. Crewed aircraft are flown by an onboard pilot, whereas unmanned aerial vehicles may be remotely controlled or self-controlled by onboard computers.
