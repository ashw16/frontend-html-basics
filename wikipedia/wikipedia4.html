    <h1>Avionics</h1>
    <p><b>Avionics </b> (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blend_word">blend</a> of aviation and electronics) are the electronic systems used on aircraft. Avionic systems include communications, navigation, the display and management of multiple systems, and the hundreds of systems that are fitted to aircraft to perform individual functions. These can be as simple as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searchlight">searchlight</a> for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_aviation">police helicopter</a> or as complicated as the tactical system for an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_early_warning_and_control">airborne early warning platform</a></p>
